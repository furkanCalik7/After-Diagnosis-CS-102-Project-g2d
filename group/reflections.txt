   In this project, we learnt how to work collaboratively and construct a complex desktop application by using java and database. We have learnt how to connect huge amounts of 
individually written code together as a team which helped us improve our communication skills. We discovered how crucial it is to make use of a design pattern such as MVC in a 
complex project. Specifically, we have learnt how to use database, window builder applications. We have discovered multiple IDE’s such as Netbeans, BlueJ and Eclipse and we
discovered how they can be better than each other in varying situations.

    What we did not like about the project was that we did not spend enough time in planning and partitioning our work. If we were to redo this project, we would spend more time
planning and we would start merging our codes earlier. Hardest part of the project was at times we were unable to edit another member’s code easily. This could have been prevented
by better organizing our codes. We spend a considerable amount of time together especially in the last 2 weeks. We almost worked every day and met with each other every other day
where we spent at 3 to 6 hours a day coding.

    We are proud of what we achieved as a team and how we dedicated ourselves to the project.
