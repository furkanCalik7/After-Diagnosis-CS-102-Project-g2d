# After Diagnosis CS 102 Project 
Group Number: G2D

After Diagnosis helps to connect patients and doctors after the first treatment. It will help the doctors to make a schedule for themselves and track the status and treatment of the patient. It will also facilitate the process of taking appointments for both doctors and patients. Most importantly, patients will be able to get necessary information from their doctor and inform them in the emergency situation. Patients who are not able to go to the hospital will be able to reach their doctors thanks to this program. 

Modal classes are mostly build and near complete. GUI design is planned and is being built on Eclipse IDE. View and Controllers part is under progress.
